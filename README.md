## Problem
We all know about medical mafia and how it's affecting health and services. They originated in the west and now dominating the whole world. They are those who control the medical sector like Pharmacy,Hospitals throughout the country. The main aim is to extort money by selling medicine and services.
- Corporate Hospitals runs doctors, because of centralization and low wages all the rural areas do not have specialized doctors.
- High Consultant fees because of Big corporations like Appolo Hospitals.
- Waiting time for Appointment.
- Low or None Awarness regarding Health because of which we end up paying more than required.
- Unnecessary prescription because of medical mafia.

My grand father 70 year old went to the bank next street for a withdraw, on his way he fell down due to imbalance in the legs, It was a simple wound which would stop if we apply some antiseptic and dress it, the doctor in the hospital opposite to our house recommended scanning his head! An MRI scan for the head would cost some where around INR10,000.
